# Halo 5: Forge Engine Documentation

The aim of this repository is to host high-quality unofficial documentation on the Halo 5: Forge engine, with a focus on doing things correctly rather than quick-and-dirty. This information is mainly intended for developers looking to develop proper modding tools for the engine.
